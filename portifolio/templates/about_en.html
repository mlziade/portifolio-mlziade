        <p>Hi, I'm Michel :)</p>

        <p>A naturally curious person who loves to learn more about the world around me. And obviously, it would be no different in my career.</p>
            
        <p>I'm a Brazilian developer with years of experience in the Technology Consulting market, working directly with companies of different sizes - be it clients or technology partners. Besides being a developer and Solution Architect, I also have experience as a Cloud Engineer, Pre-Sales, and Technical Leader.</p>
            
        <p>Throughout my professional journey, Iâ€™ve worked in different areas and projects: Process Automation and RPA, Customer Service/Experience (Chatbots, Omnichannel, Machine Learning / Generative AI), ETL tools, and currently, Web Development as a Backend Developer.</p>
            
        <p>ðŸŽ¯ Currently focused on learning more about Web Development, Cloud, and Infrastructure, growing as a Solution Architect and Backend Developer.</p>
        
        <p>Thereâ€™s always a new challenge ahead, and I want to be a part of it.</p>
